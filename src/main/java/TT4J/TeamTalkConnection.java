/**
 *  This class servers as a connection layer with TeamTalk server.
 *  The TeamTalk protocol is not a request/reply protocol.
 *
 *  The server can send commands which are not replies
 *  issued by the client (you). E.g. once you have logged in you can
 *  get a command from the server saying that a user has joined a
 *  channel which is not related to any command you have issued. To
 *  know if a command is a reply to a command you have issued you need
 *  to put in the parameter "id=123" where 123 is the command ID of the
 *  command you want to trace. The server will then encapsulate its
 *  reply to your command in 'begin' - 'end' replies.
 *
 *  Although it may sound complicated it's very simple. Say you have
 *  logged on to a server and want to list all user accounts. You do
 *  this by issuing the command "listaccounts id=123". The server will
 *  send repond like this:
 *
 *  begin id=123
 *  useraccount username="ben" password="pass123" usertype=1
 *  useraccount username="jill" password="pppjjj" usertype=2
 *  ok
 *  end id=123
 *
 *  When you get the 'end' command it means there will be no more
 *  commands issued by the server related to the command with the
 *  specified 'id'. The 'ok' command reply means that the command
 *  executed successfully. Had it not the command 'error' would have
 *  been returned like in the following example:
 *
 *  begin id=123
 *  error number=2006 message="Command not authorized"
 *  end id=123
 *
 *  The 'id' parameter can be omitted which is sometimes convenient but
 *  if you want to know which commands issued by the server are related
 *  to a command issued by you you need to include the 'id' parameter.
